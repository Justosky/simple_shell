/**
*full_length - This function takes two double pointers or arrays of strings as
*argument one and two and it returns an interger which represent the total
*number of strings in the both double pointers.
*It initializes an interger variable countA and countB which will be used to
*keep track of the numbers of strings in StringsA and StringsB respectively
*It uses a loop to check that both arrays of pointers are not NULL and
*it increments countA and countB respectively.
*It then returns the sum of countA and countB which represent the total number
*of strings in both arrays of pointers.
*@StringsA: The first array of pointer which length will bw calculated
*@StringsB: The second array of pointer which length will be calculated
*Return: Return the sum of StringsA and StringsB which is the total
*number of strings that both arguments contain.
